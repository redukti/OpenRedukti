# dmr_C is a C Parser and JIT compiler

Ravi includes a copy of the [dmr_C](https://github.com/dibyendumajumdar/dmr_c) project. See the project for more details regarding dmr_C.

## Goals

* Use dmr_C to translate code to JIT backend such as OMR JIT, NanoJIT or LLVM. 
* Expose dmr_C features such as C parser, and compiler to users so that they can also compile chunks of C code when necessary
